# Introduction

This model simulates how agents move and exchange wealth in a grid.  
The goal is to observe how wealth is distributed across space and among agents after a number of steps.  

# Model Description

- The model is made up of *n* agents placed randomly on a 10x10 grid.  
- Each agent starts with a wealth value randomly chosen between **1 and 5**.  

# Agent Behavior

- At each step (with the total number of steps set to **100**):  
  1. Each agent looks at its neighboring cells.  
  2. If one of them has a higher average wealth per agent than the agentâ€™s own wealth, it moves to that cell.  
  3. Otherwise, the agent stays in its current cell.  
  4. After moving (or staying), the agent randomly gives **1 unit of wealth** to another agent in the same cell.  

# Results

- After **100 steps**, it is possible to observe:  
  - The **spatial distribution of wealth** across the grid.  
  - The **overall distribution of wealth** among all agents.
